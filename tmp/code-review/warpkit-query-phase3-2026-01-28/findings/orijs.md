**Reviewer**: orijs
**Review ID**: warpkit-query-phase3-2026-01-28
**Target**: frameworks/warpkit/packages/query/src/

---

## No Relevant Files

Target does not contain files in my review domain. No issues to report.

**Analysis**:
- Target is `@warpkit/query` package (Svelte 5 framework code)
- No `@orijs/*` imports found
- No Bun-specific patterns found
- Package has `svelte` peer dependency, not Bun runtime
- Files are in `frameworks/warpkit/`, not `frameworks/orijs/` or `packages/backend/ori/`

OriJS files would be located in:
- `frameworks/orijs/`
- `packages/backend/ori/`
- `apps/backend/ori/`

This target is WarpKit framework code and should be reviewed by the WarpKit/Svelte 5 reviewer.
